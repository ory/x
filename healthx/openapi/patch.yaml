        This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when {{.ProjectHumanName}} is accepting incoming
        HTTP requests. This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.

        If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the
        `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to be set.

        Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never
        refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.
